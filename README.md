Development of Wine Protocol.

Wine Protocol is a web3 project that aims at revolutionising the wine industry by developing a new economy that will centre around the various technologies offered by the blockchain and virtual reality.
 
At first, Wine Protocol is a decentralized application where users can exploit a “Drink to Earn” mechanism by taking a picture at a bottle of wine. This software will allow the team to collect data regarding real habits of consumption of wine and pay back its community for sharing them.  

The goal of the project is to create a new digital ecosystem where:

- Users can buy goods and services, offered by our partners (wineries, bars, etc.) and profiled by our software using real data collected with the “Drink to Earn” mechanism, using cryptocurrencies;
- You can partecipate in experience guided tours of wineries recreated in scale 1:1 in the Metaverse;
- Take part in digital tasting experiences in the Metaverse, where expert sommelier and oenologist will guide you in experiencing, in the best possible way, various bottles of wine; 
- Share pictures and opinion with the community, like in a social media, and get feedback by expert of the wine sector.

Moreover, the Protocol offers the possibility of staking the native token inside a native staking platform and the possibility of acquiring, both with on-site auctions and normal drops, utility NFTs that will grant unique advantages inside the staking platform and/or inside the application.

WINE is the native payment token of the project that is used for:

- Reward in the “Drink to Earn” mechanism in exchange for sharing data regarding the user’s habits of consumption of wine. 
- Payment method inside the digital marketplace.
- DAO for partner wineries, making it possible to collect opinions on goods and services directly from the consumers.

Wine Protocol launched its Mainnet on March 2, 2022 with 400 million WINE tokens created at genesis.
